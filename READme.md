## Introduction

Medical image classification plays a crucial role in assisting healthcare professionals to accurately diagnose various medical conditions. This project aims to utilize transfer learning, a technique where a pre-trained model is fine-tuned on a new dataset, to classify brain CT scan images into different categories such as normal or Covid

## Dataset

The dataset for this project comprises a collection of brain CT scan images sourced from SARS-COV-2 Ct-Scan Dataset in kaggle. It includes labeled images belonging to 2 classes, namely as nonCovid and Covid. The dataset is preprocessed and split into training, validation, and testing sets.

## Transfer Learning

Transfer learning is employed to leverage the knowledge learned by a pre-trained neural network on a large dataset to improve the performance of our model on a smaller dataset. We use the VGG16 as a base model and fine-tune its layers to adapt it to our specific classification task.

## Model Deployment

The trained model is deployed using Flask, a web framework for Python. The deployment allows users to upload a brain CT scan image through a web interface, and the model predicts the class of the uploaded image. The prediction result is then displayed on the web page. 

## Setup

To contribute to the project or modify the code, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch for your changes
4. Make your modifications and additions to the code.
5. Commit and push your changes to your GitHub repository.
6. Create a pull request from your branch to the original repository's `main` branch.
